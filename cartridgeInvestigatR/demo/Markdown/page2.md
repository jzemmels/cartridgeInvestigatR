## 1. Preprocess

Breech face impressions are commony found on the annular region surrounding the firing pin impression on cartridge case primer. 

The algorithms will not work properly if regions other than the breech face impression region are left in the scan. 

As such, before comparing two cartridge cases, scans are often "preprocessed" to isolate the breech face impression region. 

The Preprocessing tab provides both manual and automatic tools to preprocess a cartridge case scan to isolate the breech face impressions.
